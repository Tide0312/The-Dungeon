# The-Dungeon
Welcome to "The Dungeon," where strategy, skill, and a dash of luck combine to offer an unparalleled board game experience. Designed for core board game players of all ages, this journey allows you to write your legend as you navigate a thrilling dungeon, battle fierce monsters, and collect valuable loot.

### Description of Desired Play Experience
In "The Dungeon Quest," players are immersed in a thrilling dungeon crawler where strategy, risk-taking, and adaptability are key. I want players to feel the tension and excitement of exploring dangerous dungeons, battling fierce monsters, and collecting valuable loot. The game is designed to evoke a sense of adventure and camaraderie among players as they decide whether to cooperate or compete for the ultimate victory. The overarching goal is for players to strategize their moves, manage resources effectively, and adapt to the evolving dungeon environment to emerge victorious. Also, I want the players to feel the “Yay!” after rolling a 20(actually it is a 6 in this game), and the “Damn it” after rolling a 1.

### End Goal of Game
Players navigate through a dungeon, battling monsters, collecting loot, and trading items to strengthen their characters. The end goal is to collect four souls by defeating powerful monsters and exploring the dungeon. Players must balance aggression with caution, as death sends them back to their starting point but with a chance to revive and continue their quest.

### Art Direction
The game's pictures mix dark elements and big adventures, showing how exciting and dangerous it is to explore dungeons.  Although there are not any yet, I will use and change pictures from other fantasy art to make sure everything looks good together and makes you feel like you're really there. If I use someone else's art directly or change it, I'll make sure they get a credit.
